# Pointer Playground

This project is a collection of C++ programs that demonstrate the use of pointers and memory management. It is designed to help understand how pointers work in C++ by providing simple and clear examples.

## Planned Programs

The following programs will be added to the `pointer-playground` folder:

1. **`01_print_addresses.cpp`**: Prints the memory addresses of variables.
2. **`02_modify_with_pointers.cpp`**: Demonstrates modifying variables using pointers.
3. **`03_pointer_arithmetic_arrays.cpp`**: Explains pointer arithmetic with arrays.
4. **`04_pointer_to_pointer.cpp`**: Shows how to use pointers to pointers.
5. **`05_const_pointer_variations.cpp`**: Covers constant pointers and pointers to constants.
6. **`06_dynamic_allocation.cpp`**: Demonstrates dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
7. **`07_byte_level_access.cpp`**: Explains accessing memory at the byte level.
8. **`08_void_pointers.cpp`**: Introduces void pointers and their usage.
9. **`09_pointer_difference.cpp`**: Demonstrates pointer difference and its applications.
10. **`10_function_pointers.cpp`**: Explains function pointers and their use cases.
11. **`11_pointer_to_struct.cpp`**: Shows how to use pointers with structures.

## How to Run

1. Compile the program using `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ <source_file>.cpp -o <output_file>
   ```
2. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./<output_file>
   ```
